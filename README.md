# Graphics-File
## Contains different implementation in C using graphics library.

The code is initially written in _Turbo C++_  . Remember to download all neccesaary files.

 -->The graphics.h library comes preinstalled in the Turbo C++ Compiler, however in case you donot find it feel free to download it and move it to the necessary path of your compiler.

The repositary will contain coded implementation of different algorithms used in Computer Science and Engineering curriculum of 3rd semester, so feel free to copy some of the code implemetations. These code snippets are free for anyone to use. However, if you wish to learn please try to implement these on your own. :)

 The code bits and snippets are for learning purpose only and are written by me, using my own perception. I have not copied these implementations, so if have any issues please feel free to post.

 __A note for linux users:__ You can try to insatll the graphics.h library go to youtube to know more.
___HAPPY LEARNING___
